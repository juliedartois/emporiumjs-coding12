For the site to be fully functional, you have to install bootstrap and font-awesome via npm in the terminal.
_npm install bootstrap_ => Bootstrap
_npm install --save-dev @fortawesome/fontawesome-free_ => Font-Awesome

## html/bootstrap
In the html I created the main structure of the site, I also used bootstrap classes to already style some parts of the site.
I also used bootstrap to make some parts of my site responsive.

## css/sass
To further style all the site and to finish the responsivity, I used sass which writes in my css file.

## javascript
I used javascript to create all the parts where the user interacts with the page.
- On scroll, the navbar stays fixed to the top of the page but only if you go past the logo at the top of the page.
- The connection modal in the navbar opens a modal where you can Log In or Sign up (by clicking on the title).
- You can also choose the color of the site thanks to the two buttons in the navbar. You have a choice between black and white.
- Further down on the site you can find a carousel/slideshow of different products. I first created it with html and css but made in functional with javascript.
